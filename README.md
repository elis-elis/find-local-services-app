# Local Services Q&A App

This is a simple full-stack web app built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **TypeScript**.  
It lets users ask natural-language questions about local services (e.g., cat groomers in San Francisco) and returns a helpful answer generated using mock data and simulated AI response.

> Example:  
> “Who are the top-rated cat groomers in SF, and what do they charge?”
